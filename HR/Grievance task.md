## Ways An HR can Handle Grievances Effectively
---
1. **Create a System to file grievances**:
- The first thing is to set up the grievance redressal system for our organization to help our employees to lodge complaints and grievances so that it can be resolved.Â 
- It is necessary that their complaints must be placed confidentially.
- Email System can be used to file the grievances to HR department.(format as per decided by GRC department)
- Whatsapp text messages can also be used to file grievances to HR department.(format by GRC department)
- Also, an employee from the HR department (can be co-leader or support person of that department) can be elected to address the grievances to the President of the organization.
2. **Acknowledge the grievance**:
- It is the responsibility of HR managers to listen more while dealing with employee grievance. 
- When our employees come to you mentioning over an issue, lend them your ear.
- Let our employees know that you have received their report and are willing to do something about it.
- Before doing anything we have to try to solve the grievance informally before any meeting as it may save time.
3. **Investigate**:
- Not all issues qualify for a hearing. 
- Generally, it is important to review whether the grievance is valid or not. 
- HR managers have to enquire about the incidents or situations and gather any relevant information. 
- Once the investigation is over, a formal meeting can be arranged.
4. **Hold the formal meeting**:
- The employee with the grievance should be called to be present in the formal hearing. 
- The employee can put forward any evidence that backs up his complaint and explain how they would like the problem to be resolved. 
- Later on, we can circulate the minutes of the meeting notes to the President of organization.
5. **Satisfying Solution**:
- Our aim is to go for a long-lasting solution. This prevents employees from coming back again and again with the same issue.
- The key solution here lies in identifying the root cause of the problem and making sure to solve the problem completely, with the scope of adjustments, if necessary.
